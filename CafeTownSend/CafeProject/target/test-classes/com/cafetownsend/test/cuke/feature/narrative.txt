I go to Cafe TownSend login page
I enter user name and password
Then i click on the login button
Then i verify whether the correct user is logged in through Hello Username
Then i verify the button labels for Create,Edit and Delete
Also, i  check whether the Edit and Delete buttons are disabled initially
The create button should be enabled
I check the links on the footer for correct name and on each link selection, I am taken to a respective page and i come back.


Observations:

Some page urls are https and some are http..on address bar it wont show
navavigate back not working so stored previous page url and coming back
